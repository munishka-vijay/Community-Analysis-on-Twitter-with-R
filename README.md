# Community-Analysis-on-Twitter-with-R
Categorizing vertices in a network is common across a variety of domains. Specifically, structural divisions into internally well-connected sets have been shown to be very useful in computer science. Grouping vertices using structural boundaries helps to understand the underlying processes of a network. Identifying such communities is a subject of intense research in recent years. Community Detection is defined as identifying groups of vertices in a network based on structural properties. There are many methods to identify such groups and they take a wide variety of approaches, mirroring the diversity in domains where an accurate view of structural communities is useful. Our proposed system has been designed to perform community analysis on twitter with the help of 3 in-built community structures on R â€“ cluster_label_prop, cluster_edge_betweenness and cluster_fast_greedy. It takes an input from the user in the form of keywords and provides a complete analysis on them along with suitable graphs. It applies all 3 community structures for an efficient community analysis and lots of useful data can be extracted from it.
